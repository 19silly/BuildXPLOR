	<!--  Syntax for this file:
	
		***** List of "NavObjectType" tags *****
		Required parameters:
			name: unique identifier for the nav object type
		
		***** [OPTIONAL] "Helper" sub-tag of "NavObjectType" *****
		Parameters to help draw the helper for this Nav Object
		Required parameters:
			startPos: Local space position offset of the start point of the helper arrow
			endPos: Local space direction offset of the end point of the helper arrow
		Optional parameters:
			arcHeight: [default=0.5] Max height of the arc above a straight line between start and end positions
			biDirectional: [default=1] 1 if an arrow should be drawn on both ends of helper, 0 if only at the end pos
			
		***** "NavLinks" sub-tag of "NavObjectType" *****
		Holds a list of one or more NavLink tags
		
		***** List of "NavLink" sub-tags of "NavLinks" *****
		Required parameters:
			name: unique identifier for the navlink within the current NavObjectType
			action: name of the action to be performed (Kythera will translate this action into specific sub-actions to perform)
		Optional parameters:
			costMultiplier: [default = 1.0] Amount to multiply traversal distance by to calculate navigation cost
			arcHeight: [default=helper arcHeight] Max height of the arc above a straight line between start and end positions
			           If not specified, will default to the arcHeight used by the helper for this nav object
			
		***** "Start" sub-tag of "NavLink" *****
		The point to path to in order to play the traversal action for this rule
		Required parameters:
			pos: Local space position offset of the start traversal point, relative to NavObject entity
			dir: Local space direction offset of the start traversal point, relative to NavObject entity 
			
		***** "End" sub-tag of "NavLink" *****
		The point to continue pathing from at the end of traversal
		Required parameters:
			pos: Local space position offset of the end traversal point, relative to NavObject entity
			dir: Local space direction offset of the end traversal point, relative to NavObject entity
