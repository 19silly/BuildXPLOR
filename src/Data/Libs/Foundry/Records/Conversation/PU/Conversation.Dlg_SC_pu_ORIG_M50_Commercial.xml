Instead, it simply slices its way through.The 2944 M50 was designed with one goal in mind: Make the ship that will win the next Murray Cup.

The surprising thing is, Origin may have just about done it.

The stats are an orgy of mind-bending numbers but it comes down to two things. Less weight and more power. Youll notice the nose cone has grown what I can only describe as a mustache, added to stabilize all the additional thrust that the retooled and updated Twin Hammer HM4point3 drives spew out. And the refinement doesnt stop there.

They ve narrowed the front fuselage, moved the wings forward for better balance, shaved the cockpit viewpane down to the finest it could still be and not shatter in your face.

The result. A pure flying machine. Each movement on the stick translates directly into unadulterated throttle action. Welcome back to the glory days of flying." sound="Play_DXSH_MCAV_Ad_ORIG_M50_Commercial" forceSubtitles="0"/>
